# chatbot
1 Pizza Shop. 1 Chatbot. 1 order. 


The objective is to being able to take an order from the user input and, create the possibility to modify it upon request.
In any case and for the present scope of the test, focus was made on the "UPDATE" method of the bot, rather than the full CRUD pattern scope.  

Expected user input would be in the form of the following:

      [2 large pepperoni pizzas, 3 sugar free sodas]

When in need of an order update type for example:

      'Make one soda regular'
              or
      'Make one dring regular'

Hopefully NLP and Python will perform the magic to modify the order, and have it just the way you wanted it to be. 
From here, lots of improvements can be developed. It is just a simple matter of time.
